    Parameters
    ----------
    function_space : tp.spaces.FunctionSpace
        The function space that the functions in the set should be part of.
        This defines what input and output space the functions have.
    function_set_size : int
        An integer that defines how many functions are stored in the set. 
        This is used for creating multiple functions at once and
        then storing them for later use.

    Notes
    -----
    The `function_set_size` is motivated by the case that creating functions 
    (either by computations or loading from disk) can be computationally 
    expensive if done for each function individually. Therefore, we aim
    to create multiple functions at once and then store them. When
    later functions are sampled from this set, they can be quickly returned.
    But this creation is not only done once but can be repeated after
    some time to obtain new functions.
