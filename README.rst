TorchPhysics
==============

TorchPhysics is a Python library of (mesh-free) deep learning methods to solve differential equations.
You can use TorchPhysics e.g. to

- solve ordinary and partial differential equations 
- train a neural network to approximate solutions for different parameters
- solve inverse problems and interpolate external data

The following approaches are implemented using high-level concepts to make their usage as easy 
as possible:

- physics-informed neural networks (PINN) [1]_
- QRes [2]_
- the Deep Ritz method [3]_
- DeepONets [4]_ and Physics-Informed DeepONets [5]_

We aim to also include further implementations in the future.


TorchPhysics is build upon the machine learning library PyTorch_.

Features
========
The goal of this library is to create a basic framework that can be used in many
different applications and with different deep learning methods.
To this end, TorchPhysics aims at a:

- modular and expandable structure
- easy to understand code and clean documentation
- intuitive and compact way to transfer the mathematical problem into code
- reliable and well tested code basis 

Some built-in features are:

- mesh free domain generation. With pre implemented domain types: 
  *Point, Interval, Parallelogram, Circle, Triangle and Sphere*
- loading external created objects, thanks to a soft dependency on Trimesh_  
  and Shapely_
- creating complex domains with the boolean operators *Union*, *Cut* and *Intersection* 
  and higher dimensional objects over the Cartesian product
- allowing interdependence of different domains, e.g. creating moving domains
- different point sampling methods for every domain:
  *RandomUniform, Grid, Gaussian, Latin hypercube, Adaptive* and some more for specific domains
- different operators to easily define a differential equation
- pre implemented fully connected neural network and easy implementation
  of additional model structures 
- sequentially or parallel evaluation/training of different neural networks
- normalization layers and adaptive weights [6]_ to speed up the training process
- powerful and versatile training thanks to `PyTorch Lightning`_
  
  - many options for optimizers and learning rate control
  - monitoring the loss of individual conditions while training

Additional modules:

- TorchPhysics comes with a wrapper module for `NVIDIA Modulus`_. This module serves as a bridge between the two frameworks and allows users to train TorchPhysics models with the Modulus training framework with minimal changes to their existing code. The additional installation of Modulus is required and documented in the `Wrapper Readme`_.

About
=====
TorchPhysics was originally developed by Nick Heilenkötter and Tom Freudenberg, 
as part of a `seminar project`_ at the `University of Bremen`_, in cooperation with the `Robert Bosch GmbH`_. 
Special thanks belong to Felix Hildebrand, Uwe Iben, Daniel Christopher Kreuter and Johannes Mueller,
at the Robert Bosch GmbH, for support and supervision while creating this library.

Contribute
==========
If you are missing a feature or detect a bug or unexpected behaviour while using this library, feel free to open
an issue or a pull request in GitHub_ or contact the authors. Since we developed the code as a student project
during a seminar, we cannot guarantee every feature to work properly. However, we are happy about all contributions
since we aim to develop a reliable code basis and extend the library to include other approaches.
